# MutiAgentProblemSolverAutogen
This project demonstrates automated task-solving using the **AutoGen framework**, where three AI agents collaborate under a manager agent to efficiently solve complex tasks through group chat. By leveraging multi-agent communication, the system enables seamless collaboration, intelligent task delegation, and improved problem-solving efficiency.
