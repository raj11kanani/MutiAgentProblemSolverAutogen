Multi-Agent Task Solving with AutoGen 🤖🤝
This project showcases automated multi-agent collaboration using the AutoGen framework, where AI agents work together to solve complex tasks through structured communication. The system consists of multiple agents, including a User Proxy (Admin), Coder, and Product Manager, coordinated by a Group Chat Manager to enhance efficiency in problem-solving.

🚀 Key Features
Multi-Agent Collaboration: AI agents communicate and work collectively to solve tasks.
Automated Task Execution: The system autonomously assigns and executes tasks based on agent roles.
Intelligent Task Delegation: Different agents contribute based on their expertise (coding, product ideation, etc.).
Configurable Execution: Supports customizable agent roles, execution settings, and interaction modes.
🛠 How It Works
User Proxy (Admin): Oversees the conversation and initiates tasks.
Coder (Assistant Agent): Handles coding-related problem-solving and implementation.
Product Manager: Provides creative software product ideas and strategic input.
Group Chat Manager: Manages agent interactions and ensures structured execution.
📌 Applications
Software Development Assistance – Automate coding tasks through AI-driven collaboration.
AI-Powered Brainstorming – Generate and refine product ideas with structured AI discussions.
Automated Research & Analysis – Leverage LLMs to extract insights and provide recommendations.
🔧 Customization
You can modify the agents, system messages, and execution settings to tailor the framework to your specific use case.

🚀 Future Enhancements
Support for additional AI roles (e.g., Tester, Data Analyst).
Integration with external APIs for real-world applications.
Improved task prioritization and workflow automation.
