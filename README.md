# Multi-Agent Task Solving with AutoGen 🤖🤝  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates automated **multi-agent collaboration** using the **AutoGen framework**, where AI agents work together to solve complex tasks through structured communication. The system consists of multiple agents, including a **User Proxy (Admin), Coder, and Product Manager**, all coordinated by a **Group Chat Manager** to enhance efficiency in problem-solving.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – AI agents interact dynamically to achieve a common goal.  
- **Automated Task Execution** – Intelligent delegation and execution of tasks based on agent roles.  
- **Scalable Architecture** – Easily modify the number and functionality of agents.  
- **Configurable Execution** – Customize system messages, execution settings, and agent behaviors.

## 🛠 How It Works  

### 1️⃣ User Proxy (Admin)  
Oversees the conversation, provides input, and ensures smooth execution.  

### 2️⃣ Coder (Assistant Agent)  
Responsible for writing, reviewing, and debugging code.  

### 3️⃣ Product Manager  
Generates software product ideas and strategic recommendations.  

### 4️⃣ Group Chat Manager  
Facilitates structured multi-agent communication.  

The **Group Chat** enables the agents to interact seamlessly, exchanging information and refining solutions in a collaborative manner.

## 📌 Applications  
- **Software Development Assistance** – Automate coding tasks through AI-driven collaboration.  
- **AI-Powered Brainstorming** – Generate and refine product ideas with structured AI discussions.  
- **Automated Research & Analysis** – Leverage LLMs to extract insights and provide recommendations.

## 🔧 Customization  

### 🏗 Modify Agent Roles  
Add or remove agents based on your requirements.  

### 📝 System Messages  
Define custom behaviors for different AI personas.  

### ⚙️ Execution Settings  
Adjust parameters like conversation length and task complexity.
